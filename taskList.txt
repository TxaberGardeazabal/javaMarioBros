add new functionalities:
- add rotation gizmo
find how to load spritesheets automaticaly instead of hardcoding all of them (maybe in the assetpool).
add a level class to check lives, coins, etc...
- save the prefabs instead of hardcoding all of them
- in level scenes only assets that are used should be loaded.
blocks hit by moving shells drop contents
++ add a menu scene
+ create console window
++ make UI components: text, buttons, images, events and variables
++ make UI components: digit display
++ child gameobjects sould move with parent



upgrade existing functionalities:
-- style properties window
-- add all controlls in settings class and use those
-- refractor
- add docs
- add boxcollider to enemies and items (for optimization)
- on savemenus show file name in selector
- go uids not reseting properly and stacking
begining play saves new scenes, add a notif when you play an unsaved custom level
optimize loading resources on the level (requires big changes)
+ remake block coins
+ make mario movements into separate functions and
+ make an computer playercontroller that controlls mario during cutscenes (where the player is not in control)
make moving thru pipes nicer
+ make physics them more precise and less janky

bugfixing:
- when starting play, blocks that where boxSelected don't get their original colors back
- picking shader doesn't prevent extra placement of gameobjects if the object color is too light
some window focus issues:
   gizmos break when being pulled out of viewport
   when pressing away while jdialog windows are active causes focus bugs and crashes
imgui string editing sucks
falling from the level should kill you, but no when you're underground
+ enemies that are bellow Ground despawn as they get deleted
+ collisions are janky, disabling contacts in presolve doesn't prevent unwanted collisions
++ placing objects in debug mode makes two gos with the same uid

other:
// make pillbox changes ep #58
// make object hierarchy and moving, saving, loading, copying and deleting of child gameobjects (discontinued but kinda works)
// make it possible to render fonts from ttf files (discontinued)
// migrate project to gradle (if jars don't work)
// refactor mouseControlls class, including child object interactions, colors and the annoying gizmos
