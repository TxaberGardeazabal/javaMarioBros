add new functionalities:
- add rotation gizmo
find how to initialize spritesheets automaticaly instead of hardcoding all of them (maybe in the assetpool)
+ add a menu scene and a play scene
+ add invincibility powerup
++ follow the font tutorials and place text on the screen
++ make UI components: text, buttons, images and variables
++ create a new renderBatch to render text onscreen

upgrade existing functionalities:
-- style properties window
-- add all controlls in settings class and use those
-- refractor
- add docs
- add boxcollider to enemies and items (for optimization)
- on savemenus show file name in selector
begining play saves new scenes, add a notif when you play an unsaved custom level
optimize loading resources on the level (requires big changes)
+ make mario movements into separate functions and
+ make an computer playercontroller that controlls mario during cutscenes (where the player is not in control)
make moving thru pipes nicer
+ make physics them more precise and less janky

bugfixing:
- when starting play, blocks that where boxSelected don't get their original colors back
- picking shader doesn't prevent extra placement of gameobjects if the object color is too light
some window focus issues:
   gizmos break when being pulled out of viewport
   when pressing away while jdialog windows are active causes focus bugs and crashes
imgui string editing sucks
some blocks appear invisible
+ enemies that are bellow Ground despawn as they get deleted
+ collisions are janky, disabling contacts in presolve doesn't prevent unwanted collisions

other:
// make pillbox changes ep #58
// make saving, loading and copying of child gameobjects (discontinued but kinda works)
