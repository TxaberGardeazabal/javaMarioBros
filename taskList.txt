add new functionalities:
- add rotation gizmo
find how to load spritesheets automaticaly instead of hardcoding all of them (maybe in the assetpool).
add a level class to check lives, coins, etc...
- save the prefabs instead of hardcoding all of them
- in level scenes only assets that are used should be loaded.
create a prebuilt new level
refactor non sprite based animations (mario, blockCoin)
add above cloud zones

upgrade existing functionalities:
-- style properties window
-- add all controlls in settings class and use those
- refractor
- add boxcollider to enemies and items (for optimization)
- on savemenus show file name in selector
begining play saves new scenes, add a notif when you play an unsaved custom level
optimize loading resources on the level (requires big changes)
blocks hit by moving shells should drop contents
+ make mario movements into separate functions and
+ make an computer playercontroller that controlls mario during cutscenes (where the player is not in control)
make moving thru pipes nicer
+ make physics them more precise and less janky
refactor component so it handles object types (could hace a class impementation)

bugfixing:
- go uids do not reset properly in scene creation
- when starting play, blocks that where boxSelected don't get their original colors back
- picking shader doesn't prevent extra placement of gameobjects if the object color is too light
some window focus issues:
   gizmos break when being pulled out of viewport
   when pressing away while jdialog windows are active causes focus bugs and crashes
imgui string editing sucks
imgui windows clipping into screen bar and headers not showing correctly
+ enemies should spawn as soon as the camera reaches them, and despawn if they fall off the level
+ collisions are janky, disabling contacts in presolve doesn't prevent unwanted collisions
remove play buttons from level scenes (has to be only in level editor scene)
+ when falling of the stage the camera changes to underground position

other:
// make pillbox changes ep #58
// make it possible to render fonts from ttf files (discontinued)
// migrate project to gradle (if jars don't work)
// refactor mouseControlls class, including child object interactions, colors and the annoying gizmos
