add new functionalities:
-- add rotation gizmo
-- find how to load spritesheets automaticaly instead of hardcoding all of them (maybe in the assetpool).
-- make adding, changing and removing of spritesheets in gameobjects
-- in level scenes only assets that are used should be loaded.
-- make water levels
-- add above cloud zones
- show contents of assetpool in editor (database)
- add tiny flag on castle/towers
- add  fireball explosion

upgrade existing functionalities:
-- style properties window
-- add all controlls in settings class and use those
- refractor and document
- on savemenus show file name in selector
- refactor component so it handles object types (could have a class impementation)

bugfixing:
some window focus issues:
   gizmos break when being pulled out of viewport
   when pressing away while jdialog windows are active causes focus bugs and crashes
   imgui windows clipping into screen bar and headers not showing correctly
imgui string editing sucks
player transitions jump function doesn't work correctly
- collisions are janky, disabling contacts in presolve doesn't prevent unwanted collisions
seting rotation via imgui causes it to become -inf, also causes bugs with box2d
minimize the use of javaswing to prevent incompatibility crashes
- tweak check on ground to make objects stay at the same distance from the ground (how?)
+ jumping on an airbone enemy (such as a paratroopa) sometimes trigger multiple jump detects wich messes the score system
+ change screen size
changing levels in editor messes up imgui inputs

other:
// make pillbox changes ep #58
// make it possible to render fonts from ttf files (discontinued)
// migrate project to gradle (if jars don't work)
// refactor mouseControlls class, including child object interactions, colors and the annoying gizmos
// transition desync issue: due to delta time variation the same transition may last more or less frames to complete leading to desyncs (known bug)
// picking shader doesn't prevent extra placement of gameobjects if the object color is too light (known bug)
// deleting spriteRenderers from the editor doesn't remove them from the renderer (known bug)
// avoid placing mario on any platform with continous moving/rotating except it has movingplatform component (known bug)

left to do !important:
    make a menu level
    scale UI components
    decide to change screen size ratio and UI
    make mario big or fire at the start of the level
    bug: jumping on an airbone enemy (such as a paratroopa) sometimes trigger multiple jump detects wich messes the score system
    bug: paratroopas staying in ther track after being hit by a turtle shell
