add new functionalities:
-- add rotation gizmo
-- find how to load spritesheets automaticaly instead of hardcoding all of them (maybe in the assetpool).
-- make adding, changing and removing of spritesheets in gameobjects
- in level scenes only assets that are used should be loaded.
-- make water levels
-- add above cloud zones
+ create a prebuilt new level
+ open the saveAs window when playing a new level (playing auto saves)
show contents of assetpool in editor (database)
create in settings multi button input variables (control + x...)
add particles for bricks
+ add more enemies and obstacles
+ add a debug section with debug options (console, debugDraw, colision boundaries)
+ add more customization in properties window (adding/removing components)

upgrade existing functionalities:
-- style properties window
-- add all controlls in settings class and use those
- refractor and document
- on savemenus show file name in selector
hitting blocks with enemies should kill the enemies
+ make physics them more precise and less janky
+ add boxcollider to enemies and items (for optimization)
refactor component so it handles object types (could hace a class impementation)
adjust the screen size so is 1:1 with the original game
++ finish the levelController

bugfixing:
- picking shader doesn't prevent extra placement of gameobjects if the object color is too light
some window focus issues:
   gizmos break when being pulled out of viewport
   when pressing away while jdialog windows are active causes focus bugs and crashes
   imgui windows clipping into screen bar and headers not showing correctly
imgui string editing sucks
player transitions jump function doesn't work correctly
mario title image renders incorrectly
+ enemies should spawn only as soon as the camera reaches them
+ collisions are janky, disabling contacts in presolve doesn't prevent unwanted collisions
+ adjust mario hitboxes in the big and small forms to prevent clipping
+ upon winning game crashes due to not finding hud element
seting rotation via imgui causes it to become -inf, also causes bugs with box2d

other:
// make pillbox changes ep #58
// make it possible to render fonts from ttf files (discontinued)
// migrate project to gradle (if jars don't work)
// refactor mouseControlls class, including child object interactions, colors and the annoying gizmos
// transition desync issue: due to delta time variation the same transition may last more or less frames to complete leading to desyncs
