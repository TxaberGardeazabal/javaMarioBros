add new functionalities:
- add rotation gizmo
find how to initialize spritesheets automaticaly instead of hardcoding all of them (maybe in the assetpool)
add a level class to check lives, coins, etc...
- save the prefabs instead of hardcoding all of them
blocks hit by moving shells drop contents
+ add a menu scene and a play scene
++ make UI components: text, buttons, images and variables


upgrade existing functionalities:
-- style properties window
-- add all controlls in settings class and use those
-- refractor
- add docs
- add boxcollider to enemies and items (for optimization)
- on savemenus show file name in selector
begining play saves new scenes, add a notif when you play an unsaved custom level
optimize loading resources on the level (requires big changes)
+ remake block coins
+ make mario movements into separate functions and
+ make an computer playercontroller that controlls mario during cutscenes (where the player is not in control)
make moving thru pipes nicer
+ make physics them more precise and less janky
++ follow the font tutorials

bugfixing:
- when starting play, blocks that where boxSelected don't get their original colors back
- picking shader doesn't prevent extra placement of gameobjects if the object color is too light
some window focus issues:
   gizmos break when being pulled out of viewport
   when pressing away while jdialog windows are active causes focus bugs and crashes
imgui string editing sucks
some blocks appear invisible
fireballs appear invisible
falling from the level should kill you, but no when you're underground
+ enemies that are bellow Ground despawn as they get deleted
+ collisions are janky, disabling contacts in presolve doesn't prevent unwanted collisions
+ test the new fontRenderBatch
++ found big bug on rendering, some textures are not loaded properly

other:
// make pillbox changes ep #58
// make saving, loading and copying of child gameobjects (discontinued but kinda works)
