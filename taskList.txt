add new functionalities:
-- add rotation gizmo
-- find how to load spritesheets automaticaly instead of hardcoding all of them (maybe in the assetpool).
-- make adding, changing and removing of spritesheets in gameobjects
- in level scenes only assets that are used should be loaded.
-- make water levels
-- add above cloud zones
+ create a prebuilt new level
+ open the saveAs window when playing a new level (playing auto saves)
- show contents of assetpool in editor (database)
+ add all that is left for the first levels

upgrade existing functionalities:
-- style properties window
-- add all controlls in settings class and use those
- refractor and document
- on savemenus show file name in selector
add tiny flag on castle/towers
refactor component so it handles object types (could have a class impementation)
adjust the screen size so is 1:1 with the original game

bugfixing:
some window focus issues:
   gizmos break when being pulled out of viewport
   when pressing away while jdialog windows are active causes focus bugs and crashes
   imgui windows clipping into screen bar and headers not showing correctly
imgui string editing sucks
player transitions jump function doesn't work correctly
mario title image renders incorrectly
+ collisions are janky, disabling contacts in presolve doesn't prevent unwanted collisions
seting rotation via imgui causes it to become -inf, also causes bugs with box2d
minimize the use of javaswing to prevent incompatibility crashes
+ tweak check on ground to make objects stay at the same distance from the ground (how?)
+ you can set parent object as its childs child and cause them to implode

other:
// make pillbox changes ep #58
// make it possible to render fonts from ttf files (discontinued)
// migrate project to gradle (if jars don't work)
// refactor mouseControlls class, including child object interactions, colors and the annoying gizmos
// transition desync issue: due to delta time variation the same transition may last more or less frames to complete leading to desyncs (known bug)
// picking shader doesn't prevent extra placement of gameobjects if the object color is too light (known bug)
// deleting spriteRenderers from the editor doesn't remove them from the renderer (known bug)
// avoid placing mario on any platform with continous moving/rotating except it has movingplatform component (known bug)
